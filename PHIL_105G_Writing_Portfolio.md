## Writing Portfolio 1
I think the current New Zealand flag is unsuitable for representing the modern New Zealand. It does not represent the New Zealand culture, it contains themes of colonialism, it resembles the Australian flag and it was not chosen and was selected democratically.

It barely represents New Zealand, since the only imagery on the current flag that actually relates to New Zealand is the Southern Cross, and even that is a weak link as many other Southern Hemisphere nations including Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Brazil.

The use of the Union Jack on the flag pushes the idea that we are somehow still a colony and are not a fully sovereign and independent nation, with our own culture and identity.

With a deep blue background, Union Jack in the canton and also the Southern Cross, both the New Zealand and Australian flags are far too similar. Famous Kiwi sports-people have acknowledged that many times during award ceremonies, the wrong flag is raised, as the two are awfully similar.

My last point is that the current flag was not selected democratically, it was designed by a naval officer named Albert Hastings Markham and was appointed solely by the Governor-General at the time, George Bowen. There was no public discourse or discussion on the process of designing and selecting a flag to represent the whole nation.

The purpose of a flag is to represent its country. Through the use of colours, symbols and imagery, a flag will paint a picture in the minds of both its citizens, tourists and foreign persons. Having an accurate understanding of a country and what it stands for results in unity, cooperation and a common banner to stand behind.

The New Zealand flag does not accurately represent modern New Zealand. There are little or weak links to New Zealand on the current flag. The Southern Cross is one of the only elements that reflect New Zealand, but even that is not unique to New Zealand, as it is used in many Southern Hemisphere countries including Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Australia.

New Zealand should not want a similar flag to Australia. The similarity of the two consistently leads to confusion at both award ceremonies world-wide, as recounted by some of our most famous sportspeople including Mahe Drysdale and Richie McCaw.

The current New Zealand flag was appointed solely by the Governor-General at the time, George Bowen. This flag referendum is an opportunity for the New Zealand public to democratically choose and select the symbol that represents, not what a single authoritarian figure decided on, over a century ago.

Therefore, for all the premises stated above, I think that the current New Zealand flag is unsuitable for representing the modern New Zealand.

The current New Zealand flag is not unique and has few links to modern New Zealand. The Southern Cross is one of the only elements that reflect New Zealand, but even that is not unique to New Zealand, as it is used in many Southern Hemisphere countries including Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Australia.

Therefore, the current New Zealand flag should be changed to represent the modern New Zealand.

New Zealand should not want a similar flag to Australia. The similarity of the two consistently leads to confusion at both award ceremonies world-wide, as recounted by some of our most famous sportspeople including Hayden Paddon, Mahe Drysdale and Richie McCaw. Paddon’s experience with flag confusion was recited first-hand in his own Facebook post.

New Zealand is a democratic country and our flag should reflect this. The current New Zealand flag was approved solely by the reigning monarch at the time, King Edward VII (Flags of New Zealand, 2015). This flag referendum is an opportunity for the New Zealand public to democratically choose and select the symbol that represents, not what a single authoritarian figure decided on, over a century ago.

Therefore, the current New Zealand flag should be changed to represent the modern New Zealand.

## Writing Portfolio 7

In this paper, I will argue that the current New Zealand flag should be changed. The current flag does not uniquely represent modern New Zealand; both in its visual elements and how it was selected. Some of the visual elements on the flag reflect a realistically separate nation from New Zealand. The visual elements are used on many other flags and the similarity to Australia's flag consistently leads to confusion. And lastly, I will discuss how the current flag was not selected representatively by New Zealand.
