# PHIL 105G Notes

## Obstacles to critical thinking

**Confirmation bias** is a tendency that people prefer information that confirms their existing opinions.

A **reasoning heuristic** is a mental shortcut we use to simplify decision making.

The **availability heuristic** is the judging the probability of an event by how easily examples come to mind.

The **framing effect** is where changes in how a question is posed results in changes in the chosen answer.

## Arguments

A **statement** is a sentence that is either true or false.

An **argument** is a group of statements including premises and a conclusion.  
A **premises** is a statement used to justify the conclusion.  
The **conclusion** is the outcome of the argument.  

A **deductive** argument is one for which the premises are offered to provide logically conclusive support for its conclusion.  
A **non-deductive** argument is an argument for which the premises are offered to provide probable, but not conclusive support for its conclusions.

A **valid** argument is a deductive argument that succeeds in providing decisive logical support.  
An **invalid** argument is a deductive argument that fails in providing conclusive logical support.

A **strong** argument is a non-deductive argument that succeeds in providing probable, but not conclusive, logical support for its conclusion.  
A **weak** argument is a non-deductive argument that fails to provide probable support for its conclusion.

A **counter-example** to an argument is a situation that shows that the argument can have true premises and a false conclusion.

An argument is valid / strong if and only if there are no counter-examples to the argument.

A **sound** argument is a deductive argument that has true premises.  
A **cogent** argument is a strong non-deductive argument that has true premises.

A **good** argument is one which is sound or cogent.  
A **bad** argument is one which is invalid, weak or has false premises.

## Virtues

The **principle of charity** is to always try to understand the strongest, most persuasive version of an argument.

The **instrumental justification** proposes that critical thinking is valuable because using it means we get closer to the truth.

The **intrinsic justification** proposes that critical thinking is valuable in its own right because it is what makes us better people.

## Fallacies
### Fallacies of relevance
**Fallacies of relevance** offer reasons to believe a claim or conclusion that, on examination, turn out to not in fact to be reasons to do any such thing.

* The **Tu Quoque fallacy** is the rejection of an argument because the person advancing it fails to practice what they preach.

* The **red herring fallacy** is when an arguer side-tracks the audience with an irrelevant issue.

* The **straw-man fallacy** is when an arguer distorts and attacks a weaker version of their opponent’s argument.

* The **ad hominem fallacy** is when an arguer attacks the person rather than evaluating the argument on its merits.  

* An **appeal to authority** is the relying on the view of apparent authorities to settle the truth of a statement or argument.

### Fallacies of unacceptable premises
**Fallacies of unacceptable premises** attempt to introduce premises that, while they may be relevant, don’t support the conclusion of the argument.

* The **false dilemma fallacy** is when an arguer presents only two options and restricts the possibility of more options.

### Formal fallacies

**Formal fallacies** are false because of their form or structure.

* The **affirming the consequent fallacy** is the inferring the converse from the original statement. The converse of $P\rightarrow Q$ is $Q\rightarrow P$.
* The **denying the antecedent fallacy** is the inferring the inverse from the original statement. The inverse of $P\rightarrow Q$ is $\lnot P\rightarrow \lnot Q$.

## Science

An **explanation** is a collection of statements asserting why or how something is the case.

### Scientific method
1. Identify a problem or pose a question.
2. Devise hypothesises to explain the event or phenomenon.
3. Derive a test for the hypothesis.
4. Perform the test.
5. Accept or reject the hypothesis.

Tests can lead us to reject a hypothesis, but not to conclude that it's true.

A **scientific hypothesis** is an explanation based on observable evidence requires that it can be testable and falsifiable.

The **falsification** of a hypothesis is the action of denying its plausibility.

An **inference to the best explanation** is a strong non-deductive argument which selects the best hypothesis that explains the observations.

A **random controlled trial** is an experiment that is used to compare the intervention to the one group than the control group.

A **double-blind** study is one where both the participants and testers do not know who is in which group.

## Law

**Analogical reasoning** comes from the observation that two or more things are similar in some respects to the conclusion that they're probably similar in some other respect as well.  
The strength of an analogy increases with the number of comparison cases, the number of relevant similarities and the absences of relevant dissimilarities.

The **burden of proof** means to be rationally required to produce evidence for your assertion claims.  
In legal contexts, the state has heavy burden of proof because they are to ensure that the basic human rights are not violated. While in usual contexts, the burden of proof is equally distributed.

## Morality

A **descriptive statement** is a statement of fact.

A **moral statement** is a claim that something is right or wrong.

A **normative statement** expresses an evaluation relative to some standard or alternative.
Moral statements are a subset of normative statements.

A **moral argument** is an argument that includes at least one moral statement.
Moral conclusions cannot be drawn directly from statements of fact.

**Relativism** is the idea that ethics is personal to each individual or culture.

## Numeracy
The **base rate fallacy** is the ignorance of the background likelihood of an event.
