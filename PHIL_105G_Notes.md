# PHIL 105G Notes

## Fallacies
The **red herring fallacy** is when an arguer side-tracks the audience with an irrelevant issue.

The **straw-man fallacy** is when an arguer distorts and attacks a weaker version of their opponentâ€™s argument.

The **false dilemma fallacy** is when an arguer presents only two options and restricts the possibility of more options.


## Scientific Method
1. Identify a problem or pose a question.
2. Devise hypothesises to explain the event or phenomenon.
3. Derive a test for the hypothesis.
4. Perform the test.
5. Accept or reject the hypothesis.

Tests can lead us to reject a hypothesis, but not to conclude that it's true.

A scientific hypothesis is an explanation based on observable evidence requires that it can be testable and falsifiable.

**Inference to the best explanation** is a non-deductive argument which selects the best hypothesis that explains the observations.
